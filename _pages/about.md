My name is Felix Kreuk. 
I am currently a Research Engineer at Meta AI research, previously Facebook AI Research (FAIR).
I completed my PhD in Computer-Science from Bar-Ilan University under the supervision of Prof. Joseph Keshet.
I've also spent time at NVIDIA Research (2019-2020).

My research interests lie in the intersection of deep-learning and speech/audio processing. Most of my recent work involves with generative models for speech and general audio.
