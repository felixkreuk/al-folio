My name is Felix Kreuk. I am a 4th year Computer-Science PhD candidate at Bar-Ilan University under the supervision of Prof. Joseph Keshet.
I am currently a Research Engineer at Meta AI research, previously Facebook AI Research (FAIR).
Before that, I was a Research Intern at FAIR under the supervision of Dr. Yossi Adi.
I've also spent time at NVIDIA Research (2019-2020).

My research interests are in machine-learning, deep-learning and their applications in speech processing, spcifically, speech synthesis.
